## My first README using Markdown syntax

This file was setup in order to experiment with "A Visual Git Reference" article, over at http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html

May the previous link prove useful to whoever might read this message over time.

Also, this is my first public `commit` ever, over at GitHub.com!

Cheers!
